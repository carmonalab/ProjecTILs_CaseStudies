# ProjecTILs Case Studies

We will be posting here interesting/instructive case studies of single-cell data analysis using [ProjecTILs](https://github.com/carmonalab/ProjecTILs):

## 1. [MC38 TILs with clonotype analysis](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/Xiong19_TCR.html)

In [this case study](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/Xiong19_TCR.html), we build an integrated scRNA-seq analysis workflow to interpret the **transcriptional** (scRNA-seq) and **clonal structure** (scTCR-seq) of tumor-infiltrating T cells in MC38 colon adenocarcinoma.

## 2. [Project human data on mouse TIL atlas](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/SadeFeldman_ortho.html)

Exploiting the ortholog mapping functionality of ProjecTILs, we project scRNA-seq from melanoma patients (Sade-Feldman, 2018) onto a mouse reference atlas, to interpret T cell phenotype differences between responders and non-responders to checkpoint blockade therapy.

## 3. [T cell diversity across multiple tissues](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/Sandu_LCMV.html)

Apply ProjecTILs to investigate transcriptional profiles of CD8 T cells in chronic infection from **six different tissues.**


## 4. [Exhausted CD8 T cells are associated with ICB responsiveness in breast cancer](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/Bassez_BC.html)

Re-analysis of the dataset by Bassez et al 2020 of breast cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy

## 5. [Memory phenotypes of CD4+ T cells after acute infection](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/Kunzli.html)

A case study of projection of virus-specific CD4+ T cells in late acute infection.


# 6. [Detecting novel/unrepresented cell states](https://carmonalab.github.io/ProjecTILs_CaseStudies/novelstate.html)

Projection of tumor-specific T cells on a viral reference, illustrating how one can interpret subtypes not represented in the reference.
